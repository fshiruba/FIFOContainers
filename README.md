# FIFOContainers
FIFO Containers for Satisfactory!

FIFO Containers is a mod for Satisfactory, written in C++/BP using Unreal Engine and the Satisfactory Modloader, which add 2 new containers to the game!

# Help Wanted!
While the logic to get some FIFO containers running is not hard to implement, making it **fast**, **secure** and **multiplayer** is a different beast!
This is my first project both with C++ and Unreal Engine, so I'm pretty sure there is a lot of room for improvement!

# The Future!
Besides making the code *better* I really wish to add in the near future a *"Sequential Storage Container"* that would push down the conveyor belts
one item of each *stack* it contains". **I have no idea on how do to this right now** :P
